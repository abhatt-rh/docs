Ensure that you see some XML and not the access denied error message.

. While still looking at Routes, change the project to `xraylab-1`. Click the URL for the `image-server`. Ensure that you do not see an access denied error message. You must to see a `Hello World` message.

. Turn on the image file flow. There are three ways to go about this.
+
You can go to the command-line (make sure you have KUBECONFIG set, or are logged into the cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deploymentconfig/image-generator --replicas=1 -n xraylab-1
----
+
Or you can go to the OpenShift UI and change the view from Administrator to Developer and select Topology. From there select the `xraylab-1` project.
+
image::medical-edge/dev-topology.png[link="/images/medical-edge/dev-topology.png"]
+
Right-click on the `image-generator` pod icon and select `Edit Pod count`.
+
image::medical-edge/dev-topology-menu.png[link="/images/medical-edge/dev-topology-menu.png"]
+
Up the pod count from `0` to `1` and save.

Alternatively, you can have the same outcome on the Administrator console.
+
Go to the OpenShift UI under Workloads, select Deploymentconfigs for Project `xraylab-1`.
Click `image-generator` and increase the pod count to 1.

== Customizing the dashboard

You can change some of the parameters and watch how the changes effect the dashboard.

. To increase or decrease the number of image generators, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deploymentconfig/image-generator --replicas=2
----
+
Check the dashboard.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deploymentconfig/image-generator --replicas=0
----
+
Watch the dashboard stop processing images.

. You can also simulate the change of the AI model version, which is an environment variable in the Serverless Service configuration.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch service.serving.knative.dev/risk-assessment --type=json -p '[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/template/metadata/annotations/revisionTimestamp","value":"'"$(date +%F_%T)"'"},{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value","value":"v2"}]'
----
+
This changes the model version value, and the `revisionTimestamp` in the annotations, which triggers a redeployment of the service.
